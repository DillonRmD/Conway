# My personal implementation of Conway's Game Of Life! (In C\C++)
* This is a personal project for fun, intended to be a fun learning experience! 
* Regular updates should NOT be expected.
* This is a work in progress, so mistakes are bound to have been made
* As of right now the only supported version is windows (Maybe more platform support to come).

# Build
 * Win32: Simply run the build.bat script and the desired binary should be output to a newly created build directory
 * Minor tinkering maybe required to get the build.bat to build a win32 binary
